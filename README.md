# smart-wheelchair
 Objective: Proposed a Gesture controlled wheelchair model for Movement.
 Heartbeat and Temperature sensors are used for monitoring health conditions of the Patient.
 Movement controlled can be done by distinctive modes like : Joystick orAccelerometer as per comfort of the
client.
 Ultrasonic sensor is used for avoiding Obstacles.
 GPS and GSM modules offer assistance to the Guardian to keep an eye on the Patientâ€™s therapeutic
conditions.
 Working on Research Paper to publish in Tier I conferences (IEEE) of sensors & IoT.
 Tools & Sensors Used : Arduino Mega, BLDC Motors, GPS, GSM, Temperature Sensor, Pulse Sensor,
Joystick, Accelerometer, Ultrasonic Sensor.
 Programming &Software Used :C, Arduino & MATLAB
 Impact : Cost Effective
